# _Ocean_
software system that provides interactive environmental simulation
***
__Preys, predators, obstacles fill the ocean.__

fishes (at each iteration move to a random nearest cell in ocean or don`t move)

predators (eat nearby prey or move)
obstacles do nothing but are an obstacle for everyone

All fish have a life cycle (all fish have time to live and to breed)
depending on the settings, the process proceeds differently
the process ends when one of the species is extinct, or all iterations have completed

number of iterations and setting of input parameters in the module
